Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a
broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both
commercial and non-commercial use.

We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference
implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
standardization. Ten Boost libraries are included in the C++ Standards
Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and in the new C++11 Standard.
C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in addition to those
from TR1. More Boost libraries are proposed for standardization in C++17.

Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference related to Boost called
C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado each May. Boost has been a
participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007.
